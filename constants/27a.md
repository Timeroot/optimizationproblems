# Chromatic number of the plane

## Description of constant

$C_{27}$ is the **chromatic number of the plane**, usually denoted $\chi(\mathbb R^{2})$ (the **Hadwiger–Nelson problem**).

Equivalently, let $U_{2}$ be the **unit-distance graph** on $\mathbb R^{2}$: its vertex set is $\mathbb R^{2}$, with an edge between distinct points $x,y\in\mathbb R^{2}$ iff $\|x-y\|_{2}=1$.
Then

$$
C_{27} \ :=\ \chi(\mathbb R^{2}) \ :=\ \chi(U_{2}),
$$

i.e. $C_{27}$ is the smallest integer $k$ such that there exists a map $c:\mathbb R^{2}\to\{1,\dots,k\}$ satisfying
$c(x)\neq c(y)$ whenever $\|x-y\|_{2}=1$.

It is known that

$$
5\ \le\ C_{27}\ \le\ 7.
$$

## Additional comments and links

- The main open question is whether $C_{27}\in\{5,6,7\}$.

- **Finite reduction (with choice).** Since $C_{27}\le 7$, the de Bruijn–Erdős theorem [dBE1951] implies (assuming the axiom of choice) that $C_{27}$ is attained by some **finite** unit-distance graph in the plane. In particular, under choice, $C_{27}$ equals the maximum chromatic number among finite unit-distance graphs in $\mathbb R^{2}$.

- **Known $5$-chromatic unit-distance graphs.** de Grey’s original construction had $1581$ vertices [deG2018]. Subsequent computer-aided work produced substantially smaller $5$-chromatic examples; see e.g. [Heu2018] and the Polymath16 project page.

- **Witness sizes for $7$ colors.** If $C_{27}=7$, then there must exist a finite $7$-chromatic unit-distance graph. Quantitative lower bounds on the minimum number of vertices needed for such a graph are known; see [Pri1998].

- **Set-theoretic issues.** The de Bruijn–Erdős reduction uses choice, and without it chromatic phenomena for related distance graphs can depend on the axioms of set theory; see [SS2003], [SS2004].
